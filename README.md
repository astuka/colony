# colony
Simple terminal simulation game that simulates a fantasy colony

# TODO
add money feature/store function in colony\
expedition update: can choose to "send on expedition", get items but also chance of dying\
leader update: one person assigned to be 'leader' at a time, for now given how high their charisma is 

# Event ideas

# Bugs
Find better way of handing dict logic in level ups\
colonists not making forges?
